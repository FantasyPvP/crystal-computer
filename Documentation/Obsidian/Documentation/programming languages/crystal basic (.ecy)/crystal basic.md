# Crystal basic
- this should be a fairly simple programming language which is statement based and uses simple functions to achieve basic tasks. 
- it would essentially be a scripting language that can be easily progammed and compiled into working code that is slightly more abstracted from binary than [[crystal assembly]] is.
- will eventually be replaced by the main [[crystal]] language but should serve as a good project to learn about how to make a compiler for a high level language be it a simple one.
- compiles into [[crystal assembly]] 

- it should be able to:
	- perform all standard mathematical operations
	- separate code into basic functions
	- manipulate memory automatically without much intervention from the user
	- have basic character manipulation and I/O


- syntax:
	- this language should be very easy to learn and use and have a somewhat similar structure to [[python]]
