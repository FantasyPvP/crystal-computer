# Syntax for Crystal .xcy
- somewhat simple to learn syntax strongly based on python
	- uses indentation to show changes of scope (loops and if statements for example)
	- each statement or expression should be on a separate line.
		- this will allow for more ease of compilation and learning the language.
	- variable types must be known at compile time so they must be inferred (maybe) or most likely we will have to declare all variable types manually, for example
		- INT x = 1
