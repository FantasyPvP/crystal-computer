# Python

- some of this project should be coded in python as it will allow for fast development times and ease of bugfixing
- more performance dependent code like the vm and compiler for the languages should be written in [[Rust]] 
- it may be a good idea to intially code all of the logic for the vm and the compiler in python as it is a lot easier to do than in rust and more people know python in order to program it. then i can apply that program into a [[rust]] program later on when it works the way we want it to
